- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on scalable distributed systems, caching strategies, and seamless interoperability across technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learningâ€”currently diving into Rust, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Flink to push the boundaries of real-time data processing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on high-performance systems, observability-driven optimizations, and event-driven auto-scaling for efficient resource management.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m exploring better ways to automate data ingestion and optimize system performance based on access patterns.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about microservices, caching, distributed systems, and why every tech buzzword eventually circles back to performance.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I treat learning new tech like a sportâ€”if Iâ€™m not exploring something new, Iâ€™m probably debugging why I did.
